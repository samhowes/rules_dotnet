Runtime considerations
======================

Runtime setup
-------------

Bazel rules maintain the list of files required to run given executable.
When the run is requested (via bazel run or bazel test) then a manifest
file is generated by Bazel. 

It was tried to use the manifest to symbolically link appropriate
dependencies, but it hasn't worked. .NET Core didn't work with dependencies
dynamically linked. 

Therefore, an alternative approach is used. The dependencies are copied
side-by-side to the target assembly. 

Bazel works best in the
[monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) scenario where all
dependencies are built by it using the same .NET Core runtime version.
An attempt to build some common open source libraries is maintained
[here](https://github.com/tomaszstrejczek/rules_dotnet_3rd_party).

However, many .NET Core projects are composed of multiple dependencies
gathered via Nuget. Those dependencies are often built using different
versions of .NET Core. Typically, msbuild-based build systems handle it
automatically by providing appropriate deps.json and runtimeconfig.json
files. See [this article](https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2017/12/21/netcore-primitives/)
for a very interesting overview.

Unfortunately, Bazel dotnet rules currently are not able to generate
these files. Therefore, if multiple versions of .NET Core are mixed then
a user has to provide them manually.
